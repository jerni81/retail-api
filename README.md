<h3>Project Description</h3>
This app allows users to access a list of all whiskey distilleries in both Scotland and Japan. These 2 whisky producing regions are well known for producing distinctive single malt whiskeys, as well as world renowned blended whiskies. The User will be prompted to make a choice, and can choose from the buttons labeled "Japan" and "Scotland" to the left of the screen. Once a country is selected it will populate a list of distilleries into the view window to the right of the screen. Each distillery will have its name, county of origin, and a select button that will allow the user to view more information. As the user selects the individual distillery they will then see an expanded view of that distillery with the overall rating and number of whiskies produced.
